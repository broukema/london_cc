Please behave professionally, respect others, have civilized debates, and also please familiarise yourself with 
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/the-sinister-effect-of-casually-sexist-comments-20160513-gouhc6.html "target="_blank" >examples</a>
of comments, jokes or behaviour
that by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" target="_blank" >stereotype threat</a> 
 risk reinforcing systematic social structures of domination related to
gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, disability,
physical appearance, body size or dietary choices.

<p>Harassment is not appropriate behaviour. 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment#Europe" target="_blank" >Sexual</a> or other harassment may include culturally inappropriate
physical contact, non-consensual sexual attention or innuendo,
deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an
individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments
related to ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
appearance, or body size.

<p>In the case of an incident of allegedly inappropriate behaviour,
the Organising Committee reserves the right to chair a moderated
discussion of the incident either immediately following the incident or later,
at the discretion of the Organising Committee. Anyone who wishes to report a
violation of this Code of Conduct is invited to speak confidentially to the Organising Committee.
