 * 2017-07 Inhomogeneous Cosmologies Toruń: The expressions "comply immediately", "violating these rules", "leave the event at the sole discretion of the organizers without a refund of any charge" suggest authoritarian procedures:
  * the spirit of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas corpus](habeas corpus) appears to be violated - absolute authority is given to the "organizers" to evict (not imprison!) a participant without any chance of appeal
  * there is no reference to the informal equivalent of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial](right to a fair trial) - "organizers" make a decision at their "sole discretion"
  * there is no reference to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence](presumption of innocence)
 Since the whole point of a code of conduct is justice - the avoidance of discriminatory behaviour - replacing discrimination by authoritarianism in which centuries-old legal principles are absent risks replacing one form injustice by another. For this reason, the 2017 Inhomogeneous Cosmologies Toruń Code of Conduct replaced the authoritarian aspects of the London Code of Conduct by non-authoritarian procedures (the right to discuss the issue).
